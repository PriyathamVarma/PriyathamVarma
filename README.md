 ## About me
 
### Hey there! 👋
I am a Data Scientist and Web 3.0 Developer with expertise in Solidity, Ethereum, and Polygon.

🚀 I am passionate about building new things and I started my first startup when I was 21. Although I failed at every step in scaling it, I learned how not to build a startup.

👨‍💻 I have extensive technical experience and started out as a normal trainee developer at a small company in India. I quickly rose to the rank of Technical Lead and worked on PHP projects with Laravel as the backend and React or Vue.js as the front end. I am also experienced in implementing developer productivity tools such as ClickUp, GitHub, and Slack channels to increase organizational efficiency.

🎓 I completed my Master's in Data Science at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in the UK. My dissertation focused on infrastructure modeling for electric vehicles using regression analysis and data preprocessing techniques. I predicted the energy demand for electric vehicles for the entire region of England up to 2030.

🤝 As a tech consultant and crypto enthusiast, I help many startups without any fees and guide small companies and individuals in implementing blockchain. I am currently working as one of the course directors for TechEducators, where I mostly focus on the Ethereum tech stack and Solidity smart contracts.

🎉 Exciting news! I am soon to announce a startup in Web 3.0. Stay tuned for updates!

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
